RE: issue with header missing when keyboard open on mobile

Okay I figured something out...when the keyboard is open I can get the header
and the messages to show if I:
- add padding-top to <Header />
- shorten the height of <Messages />

I'm sure there's a way where I could calculate it using some math.

Basically I need to do two things:
- onFocus of input (and isMobile) or on-screen keyboard? shorten heights...
- onBlur of input (and isMobile) or on-screen keybaord? length heights...

The hardest part will be doing the math calculations. Ideally I can do something
based on vh like for header...100vh - {message height} - {input height} = margin-top

for real iMessage styles, credit this: https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/jommGQ

also this is my excuse to use daisyUI: https://daisyui.com/

if i really want to get fancy, animation: https://codepen.io/fcalderan/pen/abBjOqV

maybe use React Spectrum: https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/TextArea.html
https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/Button.html

then it will be great.
