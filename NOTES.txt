RE: issue with header missing when keyboard open on mobile

Okay I figured something out...when the keyboard is open I can get the header
and the messages to show if I:
- add padding-top to <Header />
- shorten the height of <Messages />

I'm sure there's a way where I could calculate it using some math.

Basically I need to do two things:
- onFocus of input (and isMobile) or on-screen keyboard? shorten heights...
- onBlur of input (and isMobile) or on-screen keybaord? length heights...

The hardest part will be doing the math calculations. Ideally I can do something
based on vh like for header...100vh - {message height} - {input height} = margin-top
